**Authors:** Nelson F. Liu, Kevin Lin, John Hewitt, Ashwin Paranjape, Michele Bevilacqua, Fabio Petroni, Percy Liang

**Abstract:** This study investigates how effectively language models utilize long contexts, focusing on multi-document question answering and key-value retrieval tasks. The findings reveal that performance significantly declines when relevant information is positioned in the middle of long contexts, with models performing better when such information is at the beginning or end. This suggests a U-shaped performance curve, indicating a primacy bias (better performance at the start) and a recency bias (better performance at the end) in how models access information.

**Introduction:** Language models are crucial in various applications, including conversational interfaces and document processing. They operate by processing long sequences of text, but their ability to handle extensive contexts is limited by the quadratic increase in memory and computation required by Transformer architectures. While recent models can accept longer contexts, their performance on tasks requiring the retrieval of information from these contexts remains underexplored.

**Key Contributions:**
1. **Performance Analysis:** The paper analyzes how language models perform on tasks that require identifying relevant information from long contexts.
2. **Position Sensitivity:** It highlights the sensitivity of model performance to the position of relevant information, demonstrating a significant drop in accuracy when such information is located in the middle of the input context.
3. **Evaluation Protocols:** The research proposes new evaluation protocols for assessing the capabilities of long-context language models.

**Methodology:** The study employs two specific tasks—multi-document question answering and key-value retrieval—to evaluate model performance across varying positions of relevant information within long contexts.

**Key Results:**
- Performance is highest when relevant information is at the beginning or end of the context.
- There is a notable degradation in performance when relevant information is located in the middle of the context.
- The findings suggest that current long-context models do not robustly utilize information throughout their input.

This research provides insights into the limitations of language models in handling long contexts and suggests directions for future improvements in model design and evaluation.

## Document 2

The research investigates how extended-context language models utilize their input contexts, particularly in tasks requiring information retrieval from multiple documents. The study employs controlled experiments with various state-of-the-art models, including both open and closed variants, to assess their performance in multi-document question answering and a synthetic key-value retrieval task.

Key findings include:

1. **Performance Variability**: Language models exhibit a U-shaped performance curve based on the position of relevant information within the input context. Performance is optimal when relevant data is at the beginning or end of the context (primacy and recency biases), but significantly drops when the information is located in the middle.

2. **Model Architecture Impact**: Encoder-decoder models show more robustness to changes in the position of relevant information compared to decoder-only models, but this robustness diminishes when evaluated on sequences longer than those seen during training.

3. **Query-Aware Contextualization**: Incorporating query-aware contextualization improves performance on the synthetic key-value task but has minimal impact on multi-document question answering.

4. **Base Model Performance**: Even base models without instruction fine-tuning demonstrate the U-shaped performance curve, indicating that the ability to access information is a fundamental challenge across different model architectures.

The study highlights the limitations of current language models in effectively utilizing long input contexts, suggesting that improvements in model design and training strategies are necessary for better information retrieval capabilities.

## Document 3

The research focuses on understanding how language models utilize their input context in multi-document question answering (QA) tasks. The study investigates the trade-off between providing longer input contexts and the potential decrease in accuracy due to increased reasoning demands on the model.

### Key Contributions:
1. **Trade-off Analysis**: The paper examines how the length of input contexts affects model performance, particularly in open-domain QA settings where multiple documents are retrieved.
2. **Experimental Setup**: The study uses data from NaturalQuestions-Open, which includes historical queries and human-annotated answers from Wikipedia. It specifically analyzes cases where the answer is a paragraph, using passages of up to 100 tokens as documents.
3. **Retriever-Reader Models**: The research employs retriever-reader models to assess how well they can identify relevant information from a mix of documents, including distractors that do not contain the answer.

### Methodology:
- The authors retrieve k documents for each query, where one document contains the answer and k-1 are distractors. A fine-tuned retrieval system is used to select distractors that are relevant but do not contain the answer.
- The position of the relevant document within the input context is varied to evaluate its impact on performance.
- Accuracy is the primary evaluation metric, determining if the model's output includes any of the correct answers.

### Key Results:
- The performance of models like GPT-3.5-Turbo and Claude-1.3 shows that increasing the number of retrieved documents yields only marginal improvements in accuracy (approximately 1.5% and 1%, respectively).
- The findings suggest that current models struggle to effectively utilize additional retrieved documents, indicating a need for further research into how language models can better leverage long input contexts.

### Conclusion:
The study provides insights into the limitations of language models in multi-document QA tasks and proposes new evaluation protocols to enhance understanding and performance in future long-context models. The authors also release their code and evaluation data to facilitate further research in this area.

## Document 5

The research paper investigates the performance of various language models in multi-document question answering tasks, focusing on how the position of relevant information within the input context affects model accuracy. Key findings include:

1. **Positioning Impact**: The performance of models is significantly influenced by the position of relevant documents. Models perform best when relevant information is located at the beginning or end of the input context, demonstrating a "primacy bias" (better performance at the start) and a "recency bias" (better performance at the end). Performance declines sharply when relevant information is situated in the middle of the context.

2. **Model Evaluation**: The study evaluates several models, including GPT-3.5-Turbo, Claude-1.3, and MPT-30B-Instruct, under both closed-book and oracle settings. In the closed-book setting, models must rely on their internal knowledge without external documents, while in the oracle setting, they are provided with the document containing the answer.

3. **Performance Metrics**: The results indicate that models can experience a performance drop of over 20% when required to utilize information from the middle of the context. For instance, GPT-3.5-Turbo's performance can be lower in multi-document settings compared to its closed-book performance.

4. **Extended Context Models**: The paper also discusses extended-context models, noting that they do not necessarily outperform standard models when the input context fits within the context window of both types. Performance metrics for models like GPT-3.5-Turbo and its extended version are nearly identical when the context is appropriately sized.

5. **Overall Findings**: The research highlights the limitations of current models in effectively reasoning over extensive input contexts, suggesting that improvements are needed for better handling of multi-document scenarios.

These insights contribute to understanding how language models can be optimized for multi-document question answering tasks, particularly regarding the arrangement of relevant information.

## Document 6

The document discusses a synthetic key-value retrieval task designed to evaluate the ability of language models to retrieve values from input contexts. The task involves a JSON object containing key-value pairs, where each key and value is a unique, randomly-generated UUID. The objective is to return the value associated with a specified key.

### Key Contributions:
1. **Task Design**: The synthetic key-value retrieval task serves as a minimal testbed for assessing the retrieval capabilities of language models.
2. **Experimental Setup**: The study varies the number of key-value pairs (75, 140, and 300) to analyze how input context length affects retrieval performance.
3. **Model Evaluation**: The performance of various models, including Claude-1.3 and GPT-3.5-Turbo, is compared, particularly focusing on their ability to retrieve values from the middle of the input context.

### Methodology:
- The input consists of a serialized JSON object with a specified key.
- The models are tasked with identifying and returning the correct value associated with that key.
- Performance is measured by the accuracy of the models in retrieving the correct value from the input context.

### Results:
- Claude-1.3 models perform nearly perfectly across all input context lengths.
- Other models, such as GPT-3.5-Turbo, show lower performance, especially with longer contexts (140 or 300 key-value pairs).
- The study highlights challenges faced by models in accessing key-value pairs located in the middle of the input context.

### Conclusion:
The findings suggest that while some models excel in key-value retrieval tasks, others struggle, particularly as the complexity of the input context increases. This research contributes to understanding the limitations and capabilities of language models in structured data retrieval tasks.

## Document 7

The provided text discusses the performance of various language models in the context of multi-document question answering and key-value retrieval tasks, particularly focusing on how the position of relevant information within the input context affects accuracy.

### Key Contributions:
1. **Performance Analysis**: The study evaluates the accuracy of different models (e.g., Claude-1.3, GPT-3.5, LongChat-13B) in retrieving key-value pairs based on their position in the input context. It highlights that models perform best when relevant information is at the start or end of the context, with performance degrading significantly when the information is located in the middle.

2. **Model Architecture Comparison**: The research compares decoder-only models with encoder-decoder models, suggesting that encoder-decoder architectures may better utilize context due to their bidirectional processing capabilities. This allows them to potentially estimate the relative importance of documents more effectively.

3. **Query-Aware Contextualization**: The study examines how the placement of the query affects model performance. It notes that decoder-only models struggle because they cannot attend to the query tokens when they are placed at the end of the input context, which limits their ability to contextualize the documents or key-value pairs effectively.

### Methodology:
- The experiments involved varying the input context length and the position of relevant information to assess the models' retrieval performance.
- Models were evaluated on their ability to access and utilize information from long input contexts, with specific attention to the effects of model architecture and query placement.

### Datasets Used:
The specific datasets are not mentioned in the provided text, but the experiments likely involved synthetic tasks designed to test key-value retrieval capabilities across different context lengths and positions.

### Key Results:
- Models like Claude-1.3 showed high accuracy, particularly when relevant information was positioned at the extremes of the input context.
- Performance degradation was observed as relevant information was moved towards the middle of the context, especially for decoder-only models.
- Encoder-decoder models demonstrated more robust performance across varying positions of relevant information, suggesting architectural advantages in handling longer contexts.

Overall, the findings indicate that both model architecture and the strategic placement of queries are critical factors influencing the effectiveness of language models in multi-document question answering and key-value retrieval tasks.

## Document 8

The document discusses the performance of various language models in multi-document question answering (QA) tasks, particularly focusing on the impact of document positioning and query-aware contextualization. Key findings include:

1. **Model Performance and Document Positioning**:
- Encoder-decoder models (Flan-UL2 and Flan-T5-XXL) show robustness to changes in the position of relevant information when evaluated on sequences shorter than their maximum training length. However, their performance declines when the input exceeds this length, exhibiting a U-shaped curve where performance is better at the beginning or end of the context rather than the middle.

2. **Query-Aware Contextualization**:
- Implementing query-aware contextualization, which involves placing the query before and after the documents, significantly enhances performance in key-value retrieval tasks. For instance, GPT-3.5-Turbo (16K) achieves perfect performance with 300 key-value pairs when using this approach, while performance drops to 45.6% without it.

3. **Instruction Fine-Tuning Effects**:
- All evaluated models underwent instruction fine-tuning, which may influence how they prioritize information in the input context. The study compares the performance of MPT-30B-Instruct against its base model, MPT-30B, to assess the impact of this fine-tuning on multi-document QA performance.

4. **General Observations**:
- While query-aware contextualization improves performance when relevant information is at the beginning of the input, it does not significantly enhance robustness across all scenarios in multi-document QA tasks.

These findings suggest that the positioning of information and the method of contextualization are critical factors in optimizing the performance of language models in complex QA tasks.

## Document 9

The research investigates the performance of Llama-2 models of varying sizes (7B, 13B, and 70B) in the context of additional fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback. Key findings include:

1. **U-Shaped Performance Curve**: The study identifies a U-shaped performance curve in larger models (13B and 70B), where performance is highest when relevant information is positioned at the start or end of the input context. In contrast, the 7B model exhibits a recency bias, favoring more recent tokens.

2. **Impact of Fine-Tuning**: Supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning slightly mitigate positional bias in smaller models (13B), but have minimal effect on larger models (70B). This suggests that while fine-tuning improves overall performance, it does not fundamentally alter the positional bias trends.

3. **Context Length Trade-Off**: The research explores whether longer input contexts are beneficial for language models. It concludes that while more context can enhance performance, it also increases the reasoning burden on the model, potentially decreasing accuracy. The effectiveness of longer contexts is task-specific, depending on the model's ability to utilize the additional information.

4. **Open-Domain QA Case Study**: The study employs a retriever-reader setup using a retrieval system (Contriever) fine-tuned on MS-MARCO to evaluate the trade-off between retriever recall and reader accuracy as a function of the number of retrieved documents. This analysis aims to understand how well language models can leverage longer-range information in practical applications.

Overall, the findings contribute to understanding how model size, fine-tuning, and context length affect the performance of language models in open-domain question answering tasks.

## Document 10

The research paper discusses the performance of various language models in relation to the number of retrieved documents and their ability to utilize context effectively. Key findings include:

1. **Model Performance Saturation**: The performance of reader models, such as GPT-3.5-Turbo and Claude-1.3, saturates with relatively few retrieved documents (around 20), indicating that additional documents do not significantly enhance performance. This saturation occurs long before the retriever's performance saturates, suggesting inefficiencies in how models leverage extra context.

2. **Impact of Context Length**: Increasing the number of retrieved documents leads to longer input contexts, which can increase latency and cost without substantial performance gains. For instance, the performance improvement was only about 1.5% for GPT-3.5-Turbo and 1% for Claude-1.3 when using more than 20 documents.

3. **Reranking and Truncation**: The study suggests that improving how language models access retrieved information—by reranking relevant documents to place them closer to the start of the input context or truncating the number of retrieved documents—could enhance performance.

4. **Related Work**: The paper reviews prior research on long-context language models, highlighting various approaches to improve efficiency and performance, such as modifications to attention mechanisms and the exploration of non-attention-based models. It also discusses how language models utilize context, noting that they often rely more on recent information rather than effectively using longer contexts.

5. **Serial-Position Effect**: The observed performance patterns relate to the serial-position effect from psychology, where individuals tend to remember the first and last items in a list better than those in the middle. This insight may inform strategies for optimizing how language models process and recall information from longer contexts.

Overall, the findings emphasize the need for better strategies in document retrieval and context utilization to improve the effectiveness of language models in tasks requiring extensive information processing.

## Document 11

The paper investigates how language models utilize long input contexts through a series of controlled experiments. Key findings indicate that model performance significantly declines when the position of relevant information is altered, particularly when it is located in the middle of long contexts. The study explores the impact of model architecture, query-aware contextualization, and instruction fine-tuning on the models' ability to access and use context effectively.

Additionally, a case study on open-domain question answering reveals that language model performance reaches a saturation point well before the recall of retrievers. The results contribute to a deeper understanding of context usage in language models and propose new evaluation protocols for future long-context models.

## Document 14

The document discusses advancements in multi-document question answering (QA) systems, particularly focusing on the challenges posed by ambiguity and the effectiveness of various models in handling unambiguous questions. Key contributions include:

1. **Dataset and Methodology**: The authors utilize a Wikipedia dump from late 2018 as their retrieval corpus, which is compared against the NaturalQuestions dataset. They highlight the temporal mismatch between the two datasets, which can affect the accuracy of answers provided by models.

2. **Experiments on Ambiguity**: The study employs ambiguity annotations to create a subset of unambiguous questions. Experiments reveal that while models perform better on this subset, they still struggle with reasoning over the entire input context, indicating that performance issues are not solely due to difficulties in identifying relevant documents.

3. **Random Distractors**: The authors conduct experiments using random Wikipedia documents as distractors to assess the impact of irrelevant information on model performance. They find that even with higher absolute accuracy, models still face challenges in reasoning, suggesting that the presence of distractors complicates the QA task.

4. **Randomizing Distractor Order**: To further investigate biases in model performance, the authors randomize the order of distractor documents. They instruct models to generate answers based solely on provided search results, regardless of their order, to determine if performance is influenced by the perceived relevance of document placement.

5. **Key Results**: The findings indicate that while models can identify relevant documents with simple heuristics, they still exhibit reasoning difficulties, which are not entirely mitigated by improving the retrieval process or adjusting the order of distractors.

Overall, the research highlights the complexities of multi-document QA and the need for models to improve their reasoning capabilities in the presence of ambiguous and distracting information.

## Document 15

The document discusses the performance of various language models on multi-document question answering (QA) tasks, particularly focusing on how the position of relevant information within the input context affects accuracy.

Key findings include:

1. **Performance Curves**: The models exhibit a U-shaped performance curve, where accuracy is highest when relevant information is at the beginning or end of the context, and performance degrades when the information is located in the middle.

2. **Model Comparisons**:
- **GPT-4**: Evaluated on a subset of 500 random multi-document QA examples, GPT-4 achieved the highest absolute performance among the models tested, but still showed the U-shaped performance trend.
- **Other Models**: The performance of models like Claude-1.3, GPT-3.5, and Llama-2 was also assessed, with similar trends observed regarding the position of relevant information.

3. **Impact of Distractors**: The study also examined the effect of randomizing the order of distractors in the input context. Randomization slightly decreased performance when relevant information was at the beginning but improved it when the information was in the middle or end.

4. **Dataset and Methodology**: The experiments involved using a dataset of 20 total documents per input context, with a focus on how the arrangement of these documents influenced the models' ability to retrieve answers accurately.

Overall, the research highlights the importance of document positioning in multi-document QA tasks and provides insights into the comparative strengths and weaknesses of different language models.

## Document 16

The research investigates the performance of Llama-2 models of varying sizes (7B, 13B, and 70B parameters) in a multi-document question-answering (QA) task, particularly focusing on biases related to document position—specifically, primacy and recency biases. The study finds that only the larger models (13B and 70B) exhibit a U-shaped performance curve indicative of both biases, while the smallest model (7B) is solely recency-biased.

Key findings include:

1. **Model Size and Bias**: The 7B models show minimal primacy bias, whereas the 13B models demonstrate significant primacy and recency biases, with a notable 20-point accuracy difference between best and worst-case scenarios. The 70B models also show both biases, but the impact of additional fine-tuning is less pronounced.

2. **Impact of Fine-Tuning**: Additional supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback significantly improve performance on the multi-document QA task. For the 13B model, fine-tuning reduces the bias slightly, but it remains substantial. The 70B models show similar trends regardless of fine-tuning.

3. **Hypothesis on Previous Findings**: The authors hypothesize that earlier studies may not have observed primacy bias due to the smaller model sizes (less than 1B parameters) they examined.

The results are visually represented in Figure 16, which illustrates the performance of the different Llama-2 models across various document positions.

The section presents the performance results of various models on a multi-document question answering (QA) task, evaluated with different numbers of retrieved documents (10, 20, and 30). The performance is measured at different indices, indicating the position of the document containing the answer within the input context.

### Key Findings:

1. **10 Total Retrieved Documents (Table 5)**:
- **GPT-3.5-Turbo** shows the highest performance at Index 0 with 76.8%, followed closely by **GPT-3.5-Turbo (16K)** at 76.9%.
- **Claude-1.3** and its variant perform lower, with scores around 62.9% and 63.1% at Index 0.
